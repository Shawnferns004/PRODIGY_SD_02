Guessing Game in Python

Welcome to my Guessing Game project! This Python-based game is designed to challenge your guessing skills and provide an enjoyable gaming experience.

### Overview:
In this project, I've developed a simple guessing game using Python. The game prompts the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Players can input their guesses, and the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

### Features:
- **Random Number Generation:** The game utilizes Python's random module to generate a random number within a specified range.
- **User Input:** Players can input their guesses through the command line interface.
- **Feedback System:** The game provides feedback to the player based on their guess, guiding them to the correct answer.
- **Score Tracking:** Players can track their score based on the number of attempts it takes to guess the correct number.

### How to Play:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script (`guess_game.py` or similarly named).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your guesses and receive feedback.
5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number!

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Custom Tkinter

### Future Improvements:
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive gaming experience.
- Add difficulty levels to customize the range of numbers for guessing.
- Include a timer to challenge players to guess within a certain time limit.

### Contribution:
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit a pull request.
